## 🔧 What to Improve / Add in the Future

- **Add Tests**: Include unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests to ensure the app's functionality and robustness.
- **Observability**: logs, metrics, and monitoring tools for better debugging and analysis.
- **Accessibility**: Implement features to make the app accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Add support for multiple languages to make the app usable for a global audience.
- **Security Measures**: Implement filters to handle vague or potentially harmful inputs more effectively.

## 🚨 Important Notes

- This repository contains only the client-side code. It is designed this way for simplicity and faster deployment using GitHub Pages, as no server is required.

- While the app functions effectively, for enhanced security and better control over input validation and other server-side processes, implementing a middleware server (e.g., a Backend-for-Frontend [BFF] or proxy) would be an excellent addition. This approach would provide extra layers of security and handle server-related tasks more robustly.
